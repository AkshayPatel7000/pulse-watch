description: Review project rules and PRD before starting any task
---

Before performing any task in the **Pinglyfy** project, follow these steps to ensure alignment with project standards:

1. **Read Project Rules**: Open and review `/home/lenovo/Desktop/PRO/Uptime Monitoring System/pulse-watch/.cursorrules`.
2. **Consult the PRD**: Read `/home/lenovo/Desktop/PRO/Uptime Monitoring System/pulse-watch/docs/uptime_monitoring_status_system_prd.md` to understand the specific requirements for the feature or fix.
3. **Verify Tech Stack**: Ensure you are using:
   - Next.js (App Router)
   - Tailwind CSS 4
   - MongoDB
   - Radix UI
4. **Adhere to Design System**: Check `app/globals.css` for the current color palette and design tokens.
5. **Check Current State**: Run `ls -R` or use `find_by_name` to understand the current file structure and avoid duplication.
